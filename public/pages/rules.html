    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>You must turn up to play as scheduled on the fixture list UNLESS you contact your opponent and re-arrange it, which you are welcome to do. Let’s not have any no- shows.</li>
        <li>A NO-SHOW is when you turn up as scheduled or arranged and your opponent fails to turn up. Highly annoying! The player giving the walkover gets 0 points for the match and the winner (ie the player being given the walkover) gets 10 points. Please email the League Organiser if this happens and explain the circumstances.</li>
        <li>Matches will be either two tie break sets and a 10 point match tie break at one set all OR three tie break sets. Agree the format at the start of each match.</li>
        <li>You are expected to play all 5 matches over the 6 week period. The minimum commitment to staying in the competition is 3 matches per round.</li>
        <li>If you are injured and cannot play, contact your opponents to let them and copy the Organiser in. Injured players will be placed on the waiting list for future rounds.</li>
        <li>If your opponent cannot offer you many dates to play (through being busy, rather than injured) then you can ask them to CONCEDE the match. Let the Organiser know by e- mail and you will score 10 points, your opponent 0.</li>
        <li>Promotion and demotion is decided on points. In principle top two go up, bottom two go down but new joiners in leagues above can mean that this is not always the case.</li>
        <li>If a player is injured during a match the result is based on the number of games/sets finished before retirement. For example, at 5/6 in the first set. The winner will get 18 points and the loser will get a point per game they won eg 6 if this is the player that is injured and can’t complete the match. An injured player who can’t complete their matches will have the scores for the completed matches kept but no further points will be allocated for those who haven’t been able to play the injured player.</li>
    </ol>
