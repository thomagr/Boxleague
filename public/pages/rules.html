        <h3>Rules</h3>

        <p>Please note: these summer leagues are Just For Fun! They are organised for those who want to keep playing
            singles
            during the months when there’s less rain and more daylight. There are no prizes for winning and we like to
            keep it
            social. See you in the bar!

        <h4>Arranging games</h4>
        <p>The boxleague has been created with each match given a scheduled date slot. The scheduled date is a preferred
            date
            only and you can of course play your match at any time - just contact your opponent to agree the actual date
            and
            time that suits you both. After you have played your match, agree which of you will enter the score in the
            Scoreboard.

        <p>Player contact information is displayed in your box (see My box Players).


        <h4>Player becomes unavailable for the boxleague (e.g. due to injury or otherwise)</h4>
        <p>Players can mark themselves as unavailable (i.e. available "no") for the duration of the league by going to
            Settings,
            updating the available flag to "no" and saving.

        <p>Prior games played by a player unavailable will not be calculated in the final score. All games by and vs the
            player
            will not count.


        <h4>Player unable to play (e.g. no time available)</h4>
        <p>If your opponent cannot offer you many dates to play (through being busy, rather than unavailable for the
            boxleague)
            then that’s OK because It’s Just For Fun. However, to keep the scores working, you can agree with your
            opponent to a
            WALKOVER for the match. You will score 10 points, your opponent 0.

        <p>In this event, no sets or games will count towards your total, you will only receive points.


        <h4>Player no show on arranged time and date</h4>
        <p>If your opponent fails to turn up at the agreed time and date then you can agree with your opponent to a
            WALKOVER for
            the match. You will score 10 points, your opponent 0. But let’s try not to let this happen!

        <p>In this event, no sets or games will count towards your total, you will only receive points.


        <h4>Player unable to complete game (e.g. due to injury or otherwise)</h4>
        <p>If your opponent cannot continue to play a current game then you can agree a CONCEDE for the match. The
            points scored
            will be equivalent to you winning the remainder of the sets.

        <p>Only completed sets and games will count towards your total, you will receive points accordingly.


        <h4>Promotion and demotion</h4>
        <p>The top two players on the boxleague's end date will be promoted up and the bottom two will be demoted down.
            The
            ranking is calculated in the following order: points(Pts), then sets difference(SD), then game
            difference(GD).

        <p>New joiners in leagues above and or players retiring may affect the final box placing. Your promotion is
            therefore
            relative to your peers and not the final boxleague.
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>Have fun and enjoy the summer tennis!</strong>

    <!--<h1>Old Rules</h1>-->
    <!--<ol>-->
    <!--<li>You must turn up to play as scheduled on the fixture list UNLESS you contact your opponent and-->
    <!--re-arrange it, which you are welcome to do. Let’s not have any no- shows.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>A NO-SHOW is when you turn up as scheduled or arranged and your opponent fails to turn up. Highly-->
    <!--annoying! The player giving the walkover gets 0 points for the match and the winner (ie the player being-->
    <!--given the walkover) gets 10 points. Please email the League Organiser if this happens and explain the-->
    <!--circumstances.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>Matches will be either two tie break sets and a 10 point match tie break at one set all OR three tie-->
    <!--break sets. Agree the format at the start of each match.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>You are expected to play all 5 matches over the 6 week period. The minimum commitment to staying in the-->
    <!--competition is 3 matches per round.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>If you are injured and cannot play, contact your opponents to let them and copy the Organiser in.-->
    <!--Injured players will be placed on the waiting list for future rounds.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
    <!--<del>If your opponent cannot offer you many dates to play (through being busy, rather than injured) then-->
    <!--you-->
    <!--can ask them to CONCEDE the match. Let the Organiser know by e- mail and you will score 10 points,-->
    <!--your-->
    <!--opponent 0.-->
    <!--</del>-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
    <!--<del>Promotion and demotion is decided on points. In principle top two go up, bottom two go down but new-->
    <!--joiners in leagues above can mean that this is not always the case.-->
    <!--</del>-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <!--<li>-->
    <!--<del>If a player is injured during a match the result is based on the number of games/sets finished-->
    <!--before-->
    <!--retirement. For example, at 5/6 in the first set. The winner will get 18 points and the loser will-->
    <!--get a-->
    <!--point per game they won eg 6 if this is the player that is injured and can’t complete the match. An-->
    <!--injured player who can’t complete their matches will have the scores for the completed matches kept-->
    <!--but-->
    <!--no further points will be allocated for those who haven’t been able to play the injured player.-->
    <!--</del>-->
