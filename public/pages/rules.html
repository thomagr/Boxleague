        <h1>Old Rules</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>You must turn up to play as scheduled on the fixture list UNLESS you contact your opponent and
                re-arrange it, which you are welcome to do. Let’s not have any no- shows.
            </li>
            <li>A NO-SHOW is when you turn up as scheduled or arranged and your opponent fails to turn up. Highly
                annoying! The player giving the walkover gets 0 points for the match and the winner (ie the player being
                given the walkover) gets 10 points. Please email the League Organiser if this happens and explain the
                circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>Matches will be either two tie break sets and a 10 point match tie break at one set all OR three tie
                break sets. Agree the format at the start of each match.
            </li>
            <li>You are expected to play all 5 matches over the 6 week period. The minimum commitment to staying in the
                competition is 3 matches per round.
            </li>
            <li>If you are injured and cannot play, contact your opponents to let them and copy the Organiser in.
                Injured players will be placed on the waiting list for future rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <del>If your opponent cannot offer you many dates to play (through being busy, rather than injured) then
                    you
                    can ask them to CONCEDE the match. Let the Organiser know by e- mail and you will score 10 points,
                    your
                    opponent 0.
                </del>
            </li>
            <li>
                <del>Promotion and demotion is decided on points. In principle top two go up, bottom two go down but new
                    joiners in leagues above can mean that this is not always the case.
                </del>
            </li>
            <li>
                <del>If a player is injured during a match the result is based on the number of games/sets finished
                    before
                    retirement. For example, at 5/6 in the first set. The winner will get 18 points and the loser will
                    get a
                    point per game they won eg 6 if this is the player that is injured and can’t complete the match. An
                    injured player who can’t complete their matches will have the scores for the completed matches kept
                    but
                    no further points will be allocated for those who haven’t been able to play the injured player.
