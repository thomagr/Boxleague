<h3>Scoreboard</h3>
<p>Click on a cell in the boxleague table to enter a score in the Scoreboard.</p>
<p>Results are entered into the scoreboard as set1 set2 [set3], with games entered for each player.
    Set3 is optional (see <a href="#/rules">Rules</a>), and can be entered either as a full set score or a 10 point
    tiebreak.
    A 10 point tiebreak can either be entered as a short tiebreak score e.g. 1:0 or a full tiebreak score e.g. 10:8.</p>
<p>Use the '+' and '-' buttons to increment or decrement the game count for each player in the set.</p>
<p>A played on date can be entered for the game. Specifying a played on date will allow you to review the history of
    your games at a later date. If a played on date is not entered then the game's scheduled date will be used.</p>
<p>Use the '+' and '-' buttons to select the games or tiebreak points (final set option). Note the number sequence for set one
    is W, C, <strong>0</strong>, 1, ... 7 and for all other sets C, <strong>0</strong>, 1, ... 99</p>
